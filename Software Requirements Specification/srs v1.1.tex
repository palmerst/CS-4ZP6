\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this project is to produce a game that will be used as a demonstration for students in a third year software engineering game design course at McMaster University.  The game will incorporate the \href{https://chipmunk-physics.net/}{Chipmunk2D} physics library and highlight its capabilities.
\subsection{The Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{The Client}
The client for this project is \href{http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~smiths/}{Dr.~Spencer Smith} of the Computing and Software department at McMaster University.
\subsubsection{The Customer}
The customer for this project are students who will take the game design course in the future.
\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders include future instructors of the game design course and other related courses.
\section{Project Description}
\subsection{Game Overview}
The game will follow along those lines allowing the user to play as his or her own character through multiple levels where the user levels up the more and better he plays. The user will be able to use multiple weapons to combat a variety of enemies.  Experience is accumulated by defeating enemies and is used to progress the hero. As the userâ€™s character progresses through the game it will become more difficult to level up as enemy difficulty is substantially increased.

The game consists of the game world, within which the hero and interact with enemies.

\subsubsection{Game World}
The maps, otherwise known as levels, provide an interactive way for the user to progress deeper into the game. Some maps have a beginning and end, like a 2-D Mario level, whereas certain levels are constant in their placement, however have more enemies.
 
The game world consists of a virtual environment in which the gameplay takes place.  This environment is made up of platforms which control where the hero and enemies are permitted to, as well as blockades which limit the possible movements of the hero throughout the game.   The maps have environmental hazards and objects which the user is able to interact with. Some objects, such as power ups, give the user temporary boosts while other map elements such as spikes and fire can cause damage to the user. Besides these two the user is also responsible for navigating around blockades placed on the level. This provides a challenge for the user as he navigates through the level.


\subsubsection{The Hero}
The hero is the protagonist of the game, and is controlled by the user.  The hero is able to move left or right and to jump in order to progress through the game.  The hero can interact with several objects in the game, such as enemies, blockades, and hazards.  When the hero comes into contact with an object an event is triggered.  Depending on the type of object, events include:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If the object is an enemy the hero will lose health and be knocked back from the enemy.
  \item If the object in a blockade the hero will be stopped and unable to pass.
  \item If the object is an environmental hazard the hero will lose health and may be knock back depending on the type of hazard.  Spikes, for example, will cause a knock-back effect, whereas fire would not.
  \item If the object is an item the hero will gain some bonus or ability.  
\end{enumerate}

%  WE CAN PROBABLY LEAVE OUT THE WEAPON SYSTEM AT THIS POINT

%The last important aspect of characters is how he uses weapons. The character will use weapons to defeat enemies. The character can cycle through weapons choosing his preferred weapon of choice.


\subsubsection{The Enemies}
	When an enemy is encountered during the game, combat may ensue if the user wishes to attack the enemy.  The use may also attempt to avoid the enemy altogether. Users can employ multiple different weapons to attack enemies. Enemies in their own capacity are capable of engaging in contact with the players. The enemies may use weapon or just come in contact with the player to instantiate damage. If the enemy weapons or the enemy itself come in contact with the user then the player loses health relative to the type of enemy it is. Different enemies deal different levels of damage. The stronger enemies may deal more damage, however are slower, whereas the weaker ones attack at a higher frequency but with less damage. The goal of the enemies is to completely make the users health reach zero.

Maps:

%Weapon functionality :
%Weapons provide a way for users and enemies to interact in combat. The user has certain weapons which are given to him as artillery, however there are environmental weapons that the user and enemies may use. Whomever reaches the environmental weapon first will get the weapon. Weapons have certain characteristics that allow the user to choose which weapon will vest suit the situation at hand. Some weapons have a higher fire rate which allows the user to attack a horde of enemies at once. The trade-off is the damage of these weapons will be lower. Certain weapons fire in a projectile range so the user can attack enemies waiting around blockades. And certain weapons have high damage, but the trade-off is these weapons have a low fire rate or long reload time. Overall, the types of weapons vary in qualities that quality of their usage depending on the situation. If ten enemies surround you may want to use a high fire weapon, however if less enemies are involved you may want to use more damage to get rid of them quickly


\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

The project is subject to the following mandated constraints:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The game must make significant use of the Chipmunk2D physics library.
  \item The game must support all major PC operating systems.
  \item Project milestones must be completed by the dates given in the CS 4ZP6 syllabus.
  \item The project must be fully completed by April 1, 2015.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
The terminology used in this project is given in \hyperref[tab:terminology]{Table~\ref*{tab:terminology}}.

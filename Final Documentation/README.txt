The Source Code folder contains most up to date versions of the headers and source files -- no makefile or build scripts.  The game should be built from the OS Independent Build folder as usual.  I added a second OS Independent Build folder that compiles the game without the menu.

Source code comments are mostly found in the header files (this was done for Doxygen).  All functions and fields are commented -- what the functions do and what the fields are for.  Comments in the source files are sparse, but I believe the code to be fairly self-commenting for the most part.



NOTE:  All textures were sourced from free texture websites/google images.

\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this project is to produce a game that will be used as a demonstration for students in a third year software engineering game design course at McMaster University.  The game will incorporate the \href{https://chipmunk-physics.net/}{Chipmunk2D} physics library and highlight its capabilities.
\subsection{The Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{The Client}
The client for this project is \href{http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~smiths/}{Dr.~Spencer Smith} of the Computing and Software department at McMaster University.
\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers for this project are students who will take the game design course in the future.
\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders include future instructors of the game design course or other similar courses, and future developers of the game.

\newpage
\section{Project Description}
\subsection{Game Overview}
For this project a 2.5-D game will be created.  It will consist of a game world within which a user-controlled hero makes progress by completing stages.  The subsections that follow provide a more detailed explanation of the game.

\subsubsection{The Story}
Platform Perils focuses on a nameless hero who finds himself lost in a world full of dangerous hazards.  It is up to the player to help the hero navigate safely through a series of perilous stages so that he can return home.

\subsubsection{Game Theme}
The game will be a fast-paced platformer game, in which the player must reach the end of stages without being killed.  The game will have an adventure theme reminiscent of Indiana Jones, and will include spears, spikes, and boulders that must be avoided by the player.

\subsubsection{Game Style}
The game will utilize 2.5-D graphics and will have a semi-realistic style.  This will be achieved through the use of textures and simulated lighting effects.

\subsubsection{The Hero}
The hero is the protagonist of the game, and is controlled by the user.  The hero is able to move left or right, and to jump, in order to progress through the game.  The hero can interact with different objects in the game.  These objects include platforms, obstacles, and hazards.  When the hero comes into contact with an object a collision event is triggered.  Depending on the type of object, these events include:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If the object is a platform, the hero is supported (if standing on) or blocked (if jumping from below)
  \item If the object is an obstacle the hero will be stopped and unable to pass.
  \item If the object is a fatal hazard, the hero will be killed.
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

The project is subject to several constraints.  The following constraints are mandated by the client:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The game must make significant use of the Chipmunk2D physics library.
  \item Project milestones must be completed by the dates given in the CS 4ZP6 syllabus.
  \item The project must be fully completed by April 25, 2016.
\end{enumerate}

The following constraints are mandated by the developers:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item User inputs devices are limited to a mouse and keyboard.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
The terminology used in this project is given in \hyperref[tab:terminology]{Table~\ref*{tab:terminology}}.  A list of constants is provided in \hyperref[tab:constants]{Table~\ref*{tab:constants}}.
\begin{table}[h]

\subsubsection{Work Partitioning}
The flow diagram in \hyperref[fig:gameflow]{Figure~\ref*{fig:gameflow}} gives a rough representation of the operation of the envisioned game.  The user interfaces include a main menu as well as an in-game menu, and an in-game interface in which all game play takes place.  The events are listed in \hyperref[tab:events]{Table~\ref*{tab:events}}.

\section{Project Issues}
\subsection{Open Issues}
There are no open issues at this time.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
Pre-existing open-source games developed using Chipmunk2D could be considered off-the-shelf solutions for this project.  These games include \href{http://www.findbestopensource.com/product/ognom-keeper}{Ognom-keeper}, \href{http://www.findbestopensource.com/product/kineticart}{Kineticart}, \href{http://www.findbestopensource.com/product/sole-scion}{Sole-scion}, and several others.  Developing a custom game, however, allows the game to be tailor-made for use as a classroom example.

\subsection{New Problems}
No new problems are expected to arise as a result of this project.
\subsection{Tasks}
The project will be broken down into the phases given in \hyperref[tab:phases]{Table~\ref*{tab:phases}}.
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{List of project phases} \label{tab:phases}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{0.5cm}>{\raggedright}p{4.5cm}X}
\toprule & {\bf Phase Name} & {\bf Summary}\\
\midrule
\printPhase & Interfaces & Programming game interfaces (i.e. working menu systems).\\
\printPhase & Structures & Programming of game structures and classes.\\
\printPhase & Mechanics & Programming of game mechanics including physics implementation.\\
\printPhase & Graphics and Sound & Addition of textures and sound to the game to provide an enhanced audiovisual experience.  This phase is non-crucial. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}
\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
There is no product being replaced, and thus no migration is required.
\subsection{Risks}
The successful completion of the project depends on overcoming the following significant risks:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In order to use the Chipmunk2D library it must first be successfully compiled.  Since we intend for the game to be compatible with Windows 7, Mac OS X, and Arch Linux, there is a significant risk for the project to fail if compilation is not achieved on all three operating systems.
  \item Chipmunk2D is a large library and its use is not straight forward.  Successful implementation of the library features is crucial to the success of the project and the failure of this poses another significant risk.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Costs}
There are no costs associated with this project.
\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
User documentation will be created as per the CS~4ZP6 guidelines.  No training will be required.
\subsection{Waiting Room}
There are no backlogged requirements at this time.
\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
There are no ideas for solutions at this time.
